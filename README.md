# Vision Transform

Vision Transform is a repository containing code for implementing vision transformers, a novel architecture for image classification tasks.

## Overview

Vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity in recent years for their ability to achieve competitive performance in image classification tasks. This repository provides an implementation of vision transformers using PyTorch, along with examples and utilities for training and evaluating these models on various datasets.

## Features

- **Vision Transformer Architecture**: Implementation of the vision transformer architecture as described in the original paper by Dosovitskiy et al.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained vision transformer models are available for transfer learning on custom datasets.
- **Training and Evaluation Scripts**: Scripts for training and evaluating vision transformers on standard image classification datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilities for data augmentation and preprocessing, including support for common transformations.
- **Integration with PyTorch**: Seamless integration with the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parte02/Vision-Transform.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download pre-trained weights or datasets if necessary (add instructions if applicable).

## Usage

- To train a vision transformer model, run:

```bash
python train.py --dataset <dataset_name> --model <model_name>
```

- To evaluate a trained model, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_model_checkpoint> --dataset <dataset_name>
```

- Additional options for training and evaluation can be found in the respective scripts.

## Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained vision transformer models are available for download from [insert_link_here]. See the documentation for instructions on using pre-trained models for transfer learning.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, encounter any issues, or wish to contribute new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
